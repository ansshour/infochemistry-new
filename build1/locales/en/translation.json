The training of specialists is carried out in a completely new direction, which has no analogues in Russia. One of the few programs developing this direction and the corresponding scientific approach is carried out only at Harvard University. The master's program «Infochemistry / Infochemistry» is implemented in English, with the involvement of the best foreign specialists in the field under study. Students have a unique opportunity to improve English by studying together with native speakers and communicating with teachers from different countries.",
